# Frontend for Lokkeroom App

This is a frontend for my Lokkeroom app. The most complicated parts where I struggle are states and props, but overall, I manage to make it work.

## Features I am working on:

- Get users of the lobby
- Join a specific lobby (when you know its name)
- Add a user to a lobby (available for admin)
- Direct messages
- Edit messages
- Solid design with patterns from other applications like WhatsApp and Telegram

All these features are already implemented on the backend side and need minor improvements (correct responses from endpoints to satisfy the need of the frontend).
