This is a frontend for my lokkeroom app. Most complicated parts where I struggle are states and props, but overall I manage to make it work.
Features I am working on: 
 +++ Get users of the lobby
 +++ Join a spicific lobby (when you know its name)
 +++ Add user to a lobby (available for admin)
 +++ Direct messages
 +++ Edit messages
 +++ Solid design with patterns from other applications like whatsup and telegram
All these features are already implemented on backend side and need minor improvelents (correct responses from endpoints to satisfy the need of the frontend)
